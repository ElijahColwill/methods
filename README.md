# Methods

## First Time Computer Setup

Install a package named `bundler` using the ruby program `gem`.

```
    $ gem install bundler
```

If you get a `connection refused` error (likely because of the school filter),
run this command instead.

```
    $ gem install bundler --source http://rubygems.org
```


## First Time Project Setup

In your project folder, install the testing packages using `bundler`.

```
    $ bundle
```

## Writing the Methods

Instructions are in the comments in `methods.rb`. Test your code as you write it, and commit when a methods is completely working.

## Testing Your Code

Run the tests

```
    $ ruby test.rb
```
